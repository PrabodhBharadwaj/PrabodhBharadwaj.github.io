    		My name is Prabodh M Bharadwaj and I am an Interaction designer. Since the day I worked on my first robotics project when I was 13 years old, I have been facinated by the technology and design of everyday products which makes our lives simpler. Designing has always been a favourite, whether its making a poster, creating simple and efficient User experiences or developing a complete brand Identity. I love crafting simple yet effective and efficient designs to solve real world problems and make our lives easier. So, if you have a project in mind, I’d love to hear from you.
